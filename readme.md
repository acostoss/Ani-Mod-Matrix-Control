# Ani-Mod Matrix Control
### Management interface for the Ani-Mod video matrix.
#### About
Needed software to control the Ani-Mod video matrix since AV racks will soon be off-limits to employees. The included software was unwieldy to the average Joe, meaning we couldn't roll it out in our centers. Will eventually expand to interface with another video matrix, projectors

Makes use of the [pyserial module](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/), among a couple built-in dependencies. Meant to be used as an executable, so a py2exe setup.py is included.

Name suggestions welcome

### Features
* Control of the Ani-Mod video matrix
* Setting of complex setups in a single click
* Output status reads
